## Welcome!
- This is my Conway's game of life approach made in python. This project relies solely on pygame. Therefore, until a .exe version is uploaded, you'll have to install pygame as a requirement.

## Installation
- I guess downloading/cloning this project is  a first.
- Second, pygame is required in order to run the simulation.
```
git install pygame
```
- After you're sure pygame is installed, you can directly run `main.py`.
## Notes
- You can edit `main` in order to change the initial grid size. Anyways, you can change the number of cells at anytime during the simulation.
- I have not optimized the program, since it runs with several for loops, the simulation may lack performance when handling a large number of cells. Keep it simple!
